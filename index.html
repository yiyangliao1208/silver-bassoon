<body><center>Twenty-three years after its debut, Sex and the City still influences how we dress. From its first episode, the show cemented itself as a cultural force to be reckoned with, changing how the masses understood modern womanhood. Exploring the nuances of female friendships, the show dissected ideas surrounding sex and dating near the turn of the millennium, conveying a message to its audience that had previously been unheard of: love comes in many forms, and you don’t need marriage to be happy.

    It was a sumptuous feast of outfits that was as groundbreaking as its core ideology; even the opening credits were a nod to street fashion. Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie Bradshaw burst onto the scene like fresh, eclectic air. The owner of over 100 pairs of heels, Carrie’s style cast color theory to the wind and made us think, “That shouldn’t work, but it does.” 
    I want to build up a site - as my catalog of how Sex and the City, using its iconic fashion tastes, shaped the outfit trend since 2000.
